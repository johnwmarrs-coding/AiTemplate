Howdy!
The idea behind this project is to create a server/client system for running simulation games for Ai competitions.
In essence, this project should provide the groundwork for developers to define their own simulation game and its rules
and then allow participants to define their own Ai to compete in the game. 

The template is still under development, but so far contains various files useful for defining a simulation. 
More details for how to create are still to come, but there is another repository titled 'AiFlight' that is meant
to be the first example and test for this template. As development of AiFlight progresses, additions will be made to 
the template if it is found that changes to the strucuture of the project could make life easier for users.
